### Why are we using github for business and marketing docs?  
  
I'm excited that [majr](https://majr.app) will be operating almost entirely in the open. This includes how we frame business, marketing and operations. Isn't that insanity for an early-stage startup? No. Let me explain. 

#### There's only proprietary configuration. Proprietary information is dead (aka just like privacy.)  
- In a world with infinite information and sense-making signals, the only thing that matters is config
- Finished goods are over. Almost all IP is always iterating. True with code, true with business docs  
- Transforms take time. No startup has time to parse internal strategy |  internal comms | external comms and so on. Collapse down to one whenever possible 
- Tooling is a huge distraction. No more Notes -> Notion -> Slack -> webflow and repeat. Simple web docs work 
- Context matters. The repository medium will unlock tracing in a way that other tools cannot 
- Publishers win. Publish everything you can
